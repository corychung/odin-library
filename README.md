# The Odin Project: Book Library

First draft of this project. Was a good refresher on Javascript but I still would like to find out how to clean up my code more. I think what works best is setting a good baseline PRIOR to creating the draft instead of the "I'll fix it later" mentality.

EDIT: Second draft has been placed as `script-as-module.js`. This is a refactored version of my original JS file following the "module pattern" as described in the lesson after this one. It made my code much more readable and understandable, as you can easily tell by comparing it to my original `script.js`.
